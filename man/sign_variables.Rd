\title{Sign Variables}
\description{
For the variables that have the _Sign suffix, the symbols in
these variables represent three conditions of the value contained in its
corresponding result variable:
\itemize{
\item "<" - The value is below the Reporting Limit (RL) with the value in the
corresponding result variable equal to the RL. An \code{NA} value in the
corresponding result variable indicates that the RL value is unknown.
\item "=" - The value is above the RL with the value in the corresponding result
variable equal to the actual value measured by the laboratory. An \code{NA} value
in the corresponding result variable indicates that the value is missing or
wasn't collected.
\item "~" - The value in the corresponding result variable was estimated by the laboratory.
