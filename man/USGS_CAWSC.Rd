\format{
a tibble with 2,164 rows and 15 variables
\describe{
\item{Source}{Name of the source dataset.}
\item{Station}{Station where sample was collected.}
\item{Latitude}{Latitude in decimal degrees.}
\item{Longitude}{Longitude in decimal degrees.}
\item{Date}{Date sample was collected.}
\item{Datetime}{Date and time sample was collected.}
\item{Chlorophyll_Sign}{Whether the Chlorophyll value is estimated (extrapolated at low end) or reported as measured.}
\item{Chlorophyll}{Chlorophyll concentration (\eqn{\mu}g \ifelse{html}{\out{L<sup>-1</sup>}}{\eqn{L^{-1}}}).}
\item{DissAmmonia_Sign}{Whether the Dissolved Ammonia value is lower than reported ("<" because it is below the reporting limit and the reporting limit is used as the value), estimated "~", or reported as the measured value "=".}
\item{DissAmmonia}{Dissolved Ammonia (mg/L). If DissAmmonia_Sign is <, this is equal to the reporting limit, NA = RL unknown.}
\item{DissNitrateNitrite_Sign}{Whether the Dissolved Nitrate Nitrite value is lower than reported ("<" because it is below the reporting limit and the reporting limit is used as the value), estimated "~", or reported as the measured value "=".}
\item{DissNitrateNitrite}{Dissolved Nitrate and Nitrite (mg/L)}
\item{DOC}{Dissolved Organic Carbon (mg/L)}
\item{DissOrthophos_Sign}{Whether the Dissolved Orthophosphate value is lower than reported ("<" because it is below the reporting limit and the reporting limit is used as the value), estimated "~", or reported as the measured value "=".}
\item{DissOrthophos}{Dissolved Ortho-phosphate (mg/L)}
