TS 9/13/22 - (user defined) data takes up rows 65 to 2995 and is affiliated with an unknown station, however it appears about half 
of those have a station listed in the Description column. These mostly were for ORBI, OBI, and RSCC. 

A count of unique sample code values (sumproduct(1/countif(F65:F2995,F65:F2995)) shows there are 756 unique values (aka station 
sample events) to sort through including replicates collected at the rate of once per run.

I copied over any station reference in the sample description into the short station name column, I then used this to change the 
long station name to match the affiliated station name, ie "Old River near Bacon Island @ USGS Pile" using variations on:
=IFS(D1582="Rock Slough @ CCWD Trash Rack","Rock Slough @ Contra Costa WD Fish Screen",D1582="Old River @ Bacon Island Floating Mail
box Platform","Old River at Bacon Island",D1582="Old River at Bacon Island","Old River near Bacon Island @ USGS Pile",D1582=
"(User Defined)","(User Defined)")  This was for samples from 03/09/2004 11:15 to 08/30/2012 10:55, please note I may have mislabeled 
the RSCC stations if trash rack and fish screen are two separate stations.

I also took this opportunity to change any (User Defined) samples with sample type of replicate to ( None ) if it had 
stations I could ID from the Description with the same time stamp and could be cross referenced against the paper record.

I also combined long station names for Three Mile Slough to match the most up to date long station name. Left RSCC stations as is
per prior email with Patrick.

Able to identify ORBI samples from 11/15/2001 to 12/9/2003 by field measurement values and time stamps, Sample 11/6/2002 13:55 
field values match field sheet for ORBI but at 13:15 time stamp. Assuming this is a data entry error and corrected.

Also able to ID RSCC samples from 9/27/2001 10:00 to 4/17/2008 11:08 using field sheets, RSCC EC on 4/23/2003 11:00 should be 265 
per field sheet, not 256

Able to ID HCHM samples from 8/10/2001 11:30 to 11/07/2001 11:00

Able to ID BLP samples from 12/11/2001 10:30 to 02/17/2010 09:57

An additional set of RSCC samples was ID'd from 2007 and 2008 sample results binders by time stamp and sample results values, for 
now I'm calling this Rock Slough @ CCWD until Patrick can disentangle these samples. The samples I changed from (User Defined) to 
this value were from to 04/03/2008 11:15

From to 01/20/2004 14:00, ID'd a number of old Rock Slough Chloride stations including RS@NorthSide and RS West of Veale Drain and
RS East of Veale Drain, and Rock Slough at Sand Mound. I have no never been to these stations.
